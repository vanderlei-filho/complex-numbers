# complex_numbers

This is a simple Rust library created for educational purposes and intended to be used in other future small projects of mine.

Complex numbers are implemented as structs based on float primitives (f64) representing the real and the imaginary parts of a complex number. There are also trait implementations for the most common algebraic operations involving complex and real numbers.

Methods for conversion between cartesian and polar forms are also present.
